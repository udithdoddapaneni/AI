requirements:
matplotlib (use pip install matplotlib)

input format:-

you can give input in two ways:-

    
    You can alter NetworkFile and QueryFile variables in the main function in Bayesian_Network_Resolver.py file

    or

    You can use interactive_mode.py file to give file name where input is given


output format:-

the output will be visible in both terminal and OUTPUT.txt file.

the answers to the queries will be outputed line by line in the order queries are asked

suppose if the queries are

q1
q2
q3


then the output will be

a1
a2
a3


where a1 is the answer for q1, a2 for q2 and a3 for q3.



additional notes:

In the input files there are prefixes like gs other than ve and rs. When we asked sir he told us to consider it as rs and solve.
So if the prefix is not ve, i am just doing rejection sampling.
